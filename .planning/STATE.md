## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Global language setting (single setting controls all components)

- Language field in SetupCompleteRequest is optional for backward compatibility - from 01-01
- Cookie-based locale (CAAL_LOCALE) instead of URL routing - from 02-01
- English messages as base with locale overlay for fallback - from 02-01
- Technical terms stay in English: Ollama, Groq, Kokoro, Piper, STT, TTS, LLM, API, n8n - from 02-02
- Language selector in Agent tab with save/cookie/reload flow - from 02-02
