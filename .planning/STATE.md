## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Global language setting (single setting controls all components)
- Piper TTS for French (Kokoro has limited French support)

- Language field in SetupCompleteRequest is optional for backward compatibility - from 01-01
- Cookie-based locale (CAAL_LOCALE) instead of URL routing - from 02-01
- English messages as base with locale overlay for fallback - from 02-01
- Technical terms stay in English: Ollama, Groq, Kokoro, Piper, STT, TTS, LLM, API, n8n - from 02-02
- Language selector in Agent tab with save/cookie/reload flow - from 02-02
- Output l10n to lib/l10n instead of deprecated synthetic-package - from 03-01
- Relative imports for AppLocalizations (package:flutter_gen deprecated) - from 03-01
