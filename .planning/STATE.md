## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Two separate providers (OpenAI-compatible + OpenRouter) rather than one generic
- OpenRouter needs specific provider due to model discovery API
- Full stack scope: backend + settings panel + setup wizard
- Use existing provider abstraction pattern in src/caal/llm/providers/
- Use "not-needed" placeholder API key for unauthenticated servers (08-01)
- Required API key validation on init for OpenRouter (no env fallback) (08-02)
- Fixed OPENROUTER_BASE_URL constant for consistency (08-02)
- Attribution headers for OpenRouter model provider compliance (08-02)
- Settings keys: openai_* for OpenAI-compatible, openrouter_* for OpenRouter (08-03)
- OpenRouter API key validation in create_provider_from_settings with env fallback (08-03)
- Empty string defaults for new provider settings (09-01)
